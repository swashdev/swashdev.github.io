The "Free Yourself" License
===========================

The "Free Yourself" License is a custom software license inspired by FreeBSD
developer [Poul-Henning Kamp][phk]'s "Beer-Ware License."  It is an
essentially [public-domain-equivalent license][pde license] granting full
freedom to any recipient of the software to change and re-license the software
as desired, with a little [careware][careware] message baked in for good
measure.  The full text of the license follows, after which you can find a
brief essay about software licensing and an explanation of the careware
message.

Explanation
-----------

I feel that the licensing terms here are fairly self-explanatory; just
bear in mind that the software is released "as-is" and without
warranty and you can modify, share, and commercially exploit the
software or do anything else with it as you so choose.

There are a few reasons why I drafted such a permissive and bare-bones
license.  Part of it is simply that a lot of popular licenses clutter
things up with legaleze that I frankly find unnecessary.  We don't
need lawyers and thinktanks to interpret what is or is not a
"[permissive][permissive license]" license; we just need to unambiguously
tell people that it's okay to copy and modify stuff and be done with it.
This is a throwback to a simpler time, when you could just share stuff
and nobody had to worry about ending up in court over it, and that
appeals to me.  I'm a practical guy and I don't feel the need to
complicate everything.

In a perfect world, I would just commit my code to the
[public domain][public domain] and be done with it, but in practice it turns
out that some jurisdictions are kind of iffy about the public domain, and like
to prosecute people for distributing public domain works anyway,
because even though the author has waived all copyright and other
interests in the software they still have to explicitly grant
permission to use it.  Your tax dollars at work, ladies and gentlemen.

So I wrote the "Free Yourself" License as an explict grant of that
permission, kind of like [the Unlicense][Unlicense]
but shorter, just how I like it.

Okay, so that's the first sentence of the license out of the way, what
about the rest of it?

Careware
--------

Besides the one-sentence public-domain-equivalent license and
liability disclaimer, the Free Yourself License contains what I call
the "careware clause," which is all of this:

> In exchange, if you ever find yourself thinking "I can't do this," or
> "I'll never be that good," I want you to stop, take a deep breath, and
> say "Yes I can."  Then prove you can.  Don't prove it to me; don't
> prove it to your friends and family; don't prove it to your boss;
> prove it to yourself.  This software is already free; now free
> yourself.

There's a reason I attached this to my software license.  On July 9th
of 2018 I got hit with a _major_ anxiety attack.  I thought I
was dying.  It turns out I wasn't dying, though; I was just freaking
out for no apparent reason.  As I sat on a bed calming down, I tried
to figure out why I was panicking, and I realized that it was because
I had allowed myself to stagnate, and had become content to suffer the
life of a failure, a fake, and a loser.  I remember thinking "you
aren't dying, but you should be.  You deserve it."  And then I
realized something...

**Fuck that noise.**

Anxiety and self-doubt can only control you if you let them.  Don't
get me wrong, they are serious problems, and it is _hard_ to
break free of them, but it _can_ be done.  If these are issues
that you struggle with, please seek help.  Reach out to your friends
and family for support; if you need it, seek therapy; practice
mindfulness and pursue passions that will give you purpose and
self-actualization.  **Free yourself** from self-sabotage
and self-deprecation.  You can do it!  It's not too late.  It's never
too late.

If you need inspiration, [this video from Markiplier][Markiplier] has helped
to remind me to have a goal and reach for it, and
[this video from Vsauce][Vsauce] has helped me learn how to bounce back from
defeats and strike out at new challenges.  For me, those challenges
came in the form of my game development projects like [SwashRL][SwashRL] and
Orange Guy's Quest.  Maybe for you it will be something else, but the point
is to enable yourself to seek your purpose.  Find your inner self, and free
them.

Of course, real mental health problems can't be fixed with a simple
word of encouragement, that well I know; but the journey of a thousand
miles begins with a single step.  If this message resonated with you,
then I hope that I've motivated you to take that first step and make
yourself into the person that you've always wanted to be.

If you find your struggle to be too much to handle on your own, please
consider calling [a crisis helpline in your area][helplines] or seeking out
another support forum.  There are people out there who genuinely want to help,
and if you look you might find they're just a few clicks away.  If you ever
find yourself thinking you're not worth anything and you don't deserve help,
please consider [this message from my friend Mike][Mike].  He changed my mind;
hopefully he can change yours.

Sincerely,
