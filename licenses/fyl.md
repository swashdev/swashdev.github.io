The "Free Yourself" License
===========================

_Updated 2024-10-24_

The "Free Yourself" Licenses are custom software licenses inspired by FreeBSD
developer [Poul-Henning Kamp][phk]'s "Beer-Ware License."  It is an
essentially [public-domain-equivalent license][pde license] granting full
freedom to any recipient of the software to change and re-license the software
as desired, with a little [careware][careware] message baked in for good
measure.

At time of writing, there have been three versions of the Free Yourself
License used by me in public repositories.  For completeness's sake, all three
are included below.

you want with it so long as you don't hold me liable for any damages;
there is no warranty.  In exchange, if you ever find yourself thinking
"I can't do this," or "I'll never be that good," I want you to stop,
take a deep breath, and say "Yes I can."  Then prove you can.  Don't
prove it to me; don't prove it to your friends and family; don't prove
it to your boss; prove it to yourself.  This software is already free;

Explanation
-----------

I feel that the licensing terms here are fairly self-explanatory; just
bear in mind that the software is released "as-is" and without
warranty and you can modify, share, and commercially exploit the
software or do anything else with it as you so choose.

All but the first draft of the "Free Yourself" License explicity place the
covered source code into the public domain, but the effect is largely the
same either way.  I'm not interested in making people jump through hoops
just so they can use my source code, and I shouldn't have to fill five
pages with legaleze just so people can use something I've publicly posted
anyway.

The problem is that a lot of jurisdictions, even in the United States, get
really cagey about copyrights, owing to how invasive, manipulative, and
outright evil modern intellectual property law is now.  A lot of courts
think that something presented on a public forum with the understanding
that other people would be able to see, copy, and use it still needs some
kind of grant of permission for you to actually exercise your God-given
rights as a citizen of the Information Age.

So I wrote the "Free Yourself" License as an explict grant of that
permission, kind of like [the Unlicense][Unlicense]
but shorter, just how I like it.
The reason all of the drafts after the first one include an explicit public
domain dedication is that I, frankly, got tired of playing the courts' word
games.  Piracy is a market inevitability, and in practice only the corpos
who are rich enough to be able to afford lawyers and extremely delusional
people really seem to care what the law says about copyrights anyway, so my
permission notice should be more than sufficient.

Okay, so that's the first few sentences of the license out of the way.  What
about the rest of it?

Careware
--------

Besides the one-sentence public-domain-equivalent license and
liability disclaimer, the Free Yourself License contains what I call
the "careware clause," which is all of this:

> In exchange, if you ever find yourself thinking "I can't do this," or
> "I'll never be that good," I want you to stop, take a deep breath, and
> say "Yes I can."  Then prove you can.  Don't prove it to me; don't
> prove it to your friends and family; don't prove it to your boss;
> prove it to yourself.  This software is already free; now free
> yourself.

<summary>The Uroboros license changed it to this, which I still believe in,
but I decided to go back to the original afterwards.</summary>

There's a reason I attached this to my software license.  On July 9th
of 2018 I got hit with a _major_ anxiety attack.  I thought I
was dying.  It turns out I wasn't dying, though; I was just freaking
out for no apparent reason.  As I sat on a bed calming down, I tried
to figure out why I was panicking, and I realized that it was because
I had allowed myself to stagnate, and had become content to suffer the
life of a failure, a fake, and a loser.  I remember thinking "you
aren't dying, but you should be.  You deserve it."  And then I
realized something...

**Fuck that noise.**

Anxiety and self-doubt can only control you if you let them.  Don't
get me wrong, they are serious problems, and it is _hard_ to
break free of them, but it _can_ be done.  If these are issues
that you struggle with, please seek help.  Reach out to your friends
and family for support; if you need it, seek therapy; practice
mindfulness and pursue passions that will give you purpose and
self-actualization.  **Free yourself** from self-sabotage
and self-deprecation.  You can do it!  It's not too late.  It's never
too late.

If you need inspiration, [this video from Markiplier][Markiplier] has helped
to remind me to have a goal and reach for it, and
[this video from Vsauce][Vsauce] has helped me learn how to bounce back from
defeats and strike out at new challenges.  For me, those challenges
came in the form of my game development projects like [SwashRL][SwashRL] and
Orange Guy's Quest.  Maybe for you it will be something else, but the point
is to enable yourself to seek your purpose.  Find your inner self, and free
them.

Of course, real mental health problems can't be fixed with a simple
word of encouragement, that well I know; but the journey of a thousand
miles begins with a single step.  If this message resonated with you,
then I hope that I've motivated you to take that first step and make
yourself into the person that you've always wanted to be.

If you find your struggle to be too much to handle on your own, please
consider calling [a crisis helpline in your area][helplines] or seeking out
another support forum.  There are people out there who genuinely want to help,
and if you look you might find they're just a few clicks away.  If you ever
find yourself thinking you're not worth anything and you don't deserve help,
please consider [this message from my friend Mike][Mike].  He changed my mind;
hopefully he can change yours.

Sincerely,
