<details>

	I lied, there are no details.  Well, I guess it wasn't a <em>lie</em>,
	per se, so much as deceptive summarization through lack of detail.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>
		This <code>details</code> tag has a <code>p</code>aragraph
		inside it.
	</summary>
	<p>
		It being a paragraph doesn't necessarily make its contents any
		more interesting, though.

	<details>
		<summary>
			This <code>details</code> tag is, itself, inside a
			<code>p</code>aragraph.
		</summary>
		That might be moderately more interesting, but I make no
		promises.
	</details>
</p>

<details>
	<summary>
		This <code>details</code> tag has a <code>blockquote</code>
		inside it.
	</summary>
	<blockquote>
		The <code>summary</code> tag being inside the
		<code>details</code> tag makes sense conceptually in the sense
		that it <em>sort of</em> follows conventions set by the XML
		standard, but it's a little confusing visually.
